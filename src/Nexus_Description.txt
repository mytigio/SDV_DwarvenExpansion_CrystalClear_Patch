[center][size=6]Dwarven Expansion / Toni's Crystal Clear[/size][/center]
A patch to add support for Dwarven Expansion features to new minerals added in Toni's Crystal Clear.

[size=5]New Machine Recipes[/size]

[size=4]Jewelry Maker[/size]
Adds 15 new Jewelry Maker recipes, each gem in Toni's Crystal Clear will create a Jewel Encrusted Dagger which is an artisan good that can be sold for profit.  They are colored based on the input gem used, and their quality and price are also based on the input gem.
Each uses the named mineral from Toni's Crystal Clear in it's creation.
[list]
[*] Alexandrite 
[*] Bornite 
[*] Gahnite 
[*] Labradorite 
[*] Spectrolite 
[*] Magnetite 
[*] SmokyQuartz 
[*] Taconite 
[*] Abelsonite

[size=4]Gemstone Polisher[/size]
Any item from Toni's Crystal Clear that uses the gem category can be improved in the gem polisher.
(this feature does not require this patch)

[size=4]Dwarven Pulverizer[/size]
All gems added by Toni's Crystal Clear will automatically pulverize in a general Gemstone Dust (named for the input) and matching in price.
These generic dusts can be used to make Infused Spirits just like any other.
